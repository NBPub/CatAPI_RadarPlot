# CatAPI_RadarPlot
Made a little cat investigator using data from https://thecatapi.com/

Used with knowledge gleaned from:
https://realpython.com/python-api/
https://python.plainenglish.io/radar-chart-basics-with-pythons-matplotlib-ba9e002ddbcd


## Potential Improvements
• Include weight info, life span

• Re-visit code and clean up with newfound knowledge

## Documentation goals
• Add initial data exploration and justification for choosing attributes to plot
