# CatAPI_RadarPlot
Made a little cat investigator using data from https://thecatapi.com/. The file uses a simple GUI (via guizero) to (1) fetch and parse data and (2) generate a random cat (info, image, plot) in a new window. 

To do: properly package code for others to run without dependencies.

## Dependencies
requests, pillow (Image), matplotlib (pyplot), numpy, pandas, guizero

math (pi), random, os


## Potential Improvements
• Include life span

• Re-visit code and clean up with newfound knowledge

## Documentation goals
• Add initial data exploration and justification for choosing attributes to plot
